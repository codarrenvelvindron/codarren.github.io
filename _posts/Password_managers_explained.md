No. Well you should!

## Passwords ?
Passwords are a tricky concept.

The more complex your password is, the better.

## Hard to remember
The more complex, the hardest to remember.

And this part can be frustrating.

## Passwords must be unique for each site
For each site, that you have an account on.

Your password needs to be unique.

## Reuse complex password everywhere?
Once someone gets a hold of your super unique password.

They can get access to ALL your accounts.

## Password managers come in
Password managers solve the above issue.

They allow you to use a "MASTER" password on the password manager.

Then, you are able to get access to all your passwords!

## Price ?
There are free and paid options out there.

But most of the time, the free options are enough.

[**Lastpass**](https://www.lastpass.com/) 

Offers unlimited password storage on multiple devices.

One of the best free password managers out there.

[**Dashlane**](https://www.dashlane.com/) 
Up to 50 passwords on the free plan.

I prefer Dashlane and 50 passwords is more than enough for me.

## Remember only ONE password
Do you think you can do that ?

Well, if you can go ahead  and start using a password manager.
