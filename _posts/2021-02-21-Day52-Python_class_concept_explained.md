## Do you know what class means ?

If you have class, it means you are a true Gentleman/Lady.

## In python, it's a little different
A class is a group of objects which share the same attributes.

A class, therefore serves as a blueprint for objects.

We say all the objects are of the same class.

It's the basis of what we call OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

## In real life, what does that mean?
Let's take keyboards.

There are all kinds of keyboards:

1. Soft-touch keyboard

2. Mechanical keyboard

3. Gaming Keyboard

4. Membrane Keyboard

5. Virtual Keyboard
