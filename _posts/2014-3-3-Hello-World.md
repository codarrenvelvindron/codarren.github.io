## Yes, I am back to blogging.
After a few years off the map. I came to the realization that many people need help. If you can be of any use to the universe, why not!

## Why I stopped blogging ?
Let's start with the obvious. My aim has always been to share what I know. But... time is limited. Using wordpress, is almost a sysadmin full time job. I'd have to install updates to wordpress and make sure that any plugin is up-to-date.

Wordpress and most CMS I have tried are a pain in the ass to say the least.

## Why I resumed blogging ?
Once I had a conversation with my buddy Kishan Takoordyal and I told him my plight. I want to blog, everyday if I can.

He pointed out that there are already solutions available to my problem.
On that day, I felt quite relieved. I thought i'd have to code some markdown to html interpreter (laughs).

## Jekyll now is your quick and elegant solution
If you want to create your personal brand with your own domain name.
And freely hosted on github servers. You'll have to pay for the domain name though (or if you don't mind using something like: codarrenvelvindron.github.io). The repository can be found here:
[Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

## Setting it up
I'll show you how to:
1. Setup your own blog hosted on Github pages
2. Get your own domain name/use your existing
3. Link your custom domain to your github.io
4. Publish your first blog post
5. Use markdown (it's super easy! [Markdown Reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet))
 
 ## 1. Setup your own blog hosted on Github pages
 Login to your github account.
 If you don't have one, create one now! :)
