Yes, there is a way to do it.

## Automation
The state of being operated automatically - [excerpt from merriam-webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/automation)

## Why ?
The why of automation is the simplest question that I can answer.

Have you ever felt like your life becomes a constant repetition?

Like you are stuck in a constant loop and unable to jump out!

We automate because robots can do repetitive tasks with more purpose than us.

They'll gladly do it for us.

## How ?
### 1. Steps
It is important that all the steps are properly figured out.

Without all the (manual) steps, our robot will be incomplete

### 2. Order
The order in which each step is executed is crucial.

Without order, we're just savages.

### 3. Do it manually
Make sure to do it manually.

The more you do it, the better laid out the steps and the sequence will be.

### 4. Expect the unexpected
It's equally important to make sure that we catch any exception there could be.

For exemple, when opening a file, there could be normally two possibilities, either the file exists or it doesn't exist.

What about the case where two names are similar ? Are we matching wildcards? Then there are more possibilities.

### 5. Keep it simple
The principle here is to keep the choices to a minimum to get out robot in working order.

The best way to do this is having 2 choices:"YES" and "NO", then there is an exception to be catched if it occurs.
