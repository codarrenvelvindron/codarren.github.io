## Proxy. Proximity ?

![Proxy image squid](https://github.com/codarrenvelvindron/codarrenvelvindron.github.io/raw/master/images/DXxSP7SVAAAnArQ.png)

The dictionary definition says it all:

Proxy: a person authorized to act on behalf of another

## In our case

A proxy server would be a server that **performs requests** and **receives responses** on your behalf.

## Since a proxy is an intermediary, it's bad

Not all intermediaries are bad. 

A proxy server won't make you pay more!

Matter of fact, there are some free and very popular proxy servers like squid.
