![Proxy image squid](https://github.com/codarrenvelvindron/codarrenvelvindron.github.io/raw/master/images/DXxSP7SVAAAnArQ.png)

The dictionary definition says it all:

*Proxy*: a person authorized to act on behalf of another

## In our case

A proxy server would be a server that **performs requests** and **receives responses** on your behalf.

## Since a proxy is an intermediary, it's bad

Not all intermediaries are bad. 

A proxy server won't make you pay more!

Matter of fact, there are some free and very popular proxy servers like [squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/).

## Classes of proxy servers

### Closed Proxy (proxy)
When we refer to a proxy, we most of the time refer to closed proxies.

These are the ones that are used within organisations to make requests on behalf of the user.
