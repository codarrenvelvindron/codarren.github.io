## I bought a mobile online

![hello moto g8 power](https://github.com/codarrenvelvindron/codarrenvelvindron.github.io/raw/master/images/motorola-moto-g-power-r1.jpg)
Upon arriving to Mauritius.

I received a notification telling me this:
```
Dear Sir,

For all items having WiFi and Bluetooth options, ICTA clearance is needed to proceed with Customs clearance
```
I was able to get clearance from ICTA.

I'm going to show you how.

## Background

I looked everywhere for this mobile phone in Mauritius.

I couldn't find it.


I currently own a Samsung Galaxy S7.

The beast lasted me 4 good years.

Now it's coming to end of life.


Was looking at multiple devices and finally settled for a great budget [Motorola G8 Power](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_g8_power-10052.php).

The greatest selling point of this is the lonnng battery life.

Needless to say, this mobile is unavailable in Mauritius.

So, I bought it online.
