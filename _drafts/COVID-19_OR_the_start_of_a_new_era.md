## Never seen or heard before

Today,31/03/2020, in Mauritius it was announced that we are going into a month of confinement.

## Covid-19 Strikes Back
In the beginning of this month, everyone was relaxed.

We were made fun of for 'still' wearing the mask.

## Did we think covid was still here ?
It never left the country.

We are not some chosen people, and there is no such thing as a Covid-free island.

There were people who were silently infected and maybe were not even aware.

That is my belief.

## Now starts a new era.

With that new era a series of changes should follow if we want to make it work long term.

### 1. IT employees --> 100% work from home
There are several thousands of IT employees in Mauritius.

And we are all concentrated 'mainly' in Ebene.

Being able to work from anywhere, there is no point having us on the streets.

Even less, concentrated in buildings containing thousands of us.

Leave that for people who really need it, like construction workers, etc...

### 2. Supermarket --> Alphabetical order
This was a great measure by the Government of Mauritius and worth all applaud.

Too many people go into panic buying mode.

We go buy too much that we can chew.

The basic instinct of survival.

But, don't forget that perishables don't last long.

It's just pointless for us to rush to supermarkets all at once.

Supermarket in alphabetical order is definitely a keeper.
