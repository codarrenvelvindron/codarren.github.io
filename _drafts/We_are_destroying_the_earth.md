## I woke up abruptly tonight
My whole body was abnormally warm/hot.

I thought to myself, I need a glass of water to cool down.

Then, the rain started pouring.

Is global warming for real ?

Here's what I found.

## GISS Surface Temperature Analysis
NASA elaborated an estimate of the global temperature called GISTEMP.

It combines land surface air temperatures into a global surface temperature data set.

When we compare the figures from 1951-1980 to recent years(2000 onwards), the results are shocking.

**2010** : 0.61 degress celcius

**2011**: 0.61 degress celcius

**2012**: 0.61 degrees celcius

**2013**: 0.62 degrees celcius

**2014**: 0.63 degrees celcius

**2015**: 0.64 degrees celcius

**2016**: 0.66 degrees celcius

**2017**: 0.68 degrees celcius

**2018**: 0.69 degrees celcius

**2019**: 0.70 degrees celcius

**2020**: 0.72 degrees celcius

## GISTEMP interesting data
It is interesting to see that the seasonal cycle increase in temperature has decreased this year.
[see picto](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v4/).

## COVID-19 beneficial to us?
It is safe to assume that the coronavirus has forced us to slow down.

And this has had a positive impact on global temperature.

## Human-made stuff outweighs all life on earth.
Did you know that all the bullshit we created now outweighs all life on earth?

Is this the reason why we are being ejected by any means possible from our own planet?

Think about it.


## What should we do from now on?
### 1. Stay at home as much as possible.
Use our cars only if necessary.

### 2. Work from home.
If you have the choice of working from home, take it.

### 3. Slow down the 'developments'
I'm not saying don't build your house.

Build it and keep the trees.

### 4. Plant trees
They allow us to breathe.

## Think before we act
We have that tendency of thinking that we can do anything.

Yes, maybe. But in doing so we are actively destroying the planet.

Every action that we do has an impact on the planet.

Believe it or not.

Don't look at what others are doing.

If we all contribute at least a little to this goal, we can still save the planet.

Yes, our planet that we are destroying.
