## 1 blogpost a day

This year, I started one blogpost per day.

## Hard at first

I have to admit, dedicating one hour everyday to blog was hard.

It demands dedication and willingness.

But I kept on going.

## Writing comes easy
There is no doubt in my mind that the more you write.

The better I become at it.

## Encouragement
I get a lot of positive feedback from people in my network.

And this is encouraging.



But this is not the reason I am doing this.

It's important that you never do things to get likes and pseudo-appreciation.

The goal is bigger than this.

## Focus
As I begin to write on a topic.

I'll try my best to be well documented on the topic.

I believe this increases my ability to focus.

## Seeing the big picture
My goal is to enable more people to embark into the wonderful world of Technology and systems administration.

I hope it will.

## Creating willingness out of thin air
Willingness to do.

Willingness to write.

I'm becoming quite good at this.
