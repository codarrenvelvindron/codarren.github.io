## Here's an idea: A publisher bot
I have been thinking about this since yesterday.
​
## One blog post a day, keeps the neurones at play
My initial goal for this year was to publish one blog post a day.
​
But, I believe I can do more.
​
Basically, the idea would be to write as much as I can per day.
​
And there would be a publisher bot that would post it everyday.
​
## What do you need?
1. A main updated repository
2. A server to host the bot
3. A way to sync
