## How is your website doing?

Pretty good :)

## How's yours doing ?

The featured image says it all, performance 100%, structure 97%, etc...

## There's nothing to do then ?

That's not so simple.

Let me explain.

## gtmetrix.com

This [tool](https://gtmetrix.com/) was introduced to me by my CTO, Vanessa Chellen, at the time I was working for them. (Thanks Vanessa!)

And it served me well.

## If we're an A grade, are we considered OK?

Not to me.

The website does load fast.

Agree, but...when we look closer.

## Unthrottled connection

![unthrottled highlighted](https://github.com/codarrenvelvindron/codarrenvelvindron.github.io/raw/master/images/unthrottled_highlighted.png)

By default, gtmetrix tests your website using an unthrottled connection.

An unthrottled connection is an unlimited connection.

An unlimited connection has no bandwidth limitation.

It could be testing your page using a gigabit connection.

## Why is it not a good test ?

Simply, not everyone has an home gigabit connection.

And particularly in Mauritius.

The fastest home connection is a 100Mb.

## My idea of testing
For me, to get a good idea of how well the website is doing.

We should test it using the slowest connection available in Mauritius.

I know a lot of times, on mobile we do switch to 3G at least on emtel.

## New result
