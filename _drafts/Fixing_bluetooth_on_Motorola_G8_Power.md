## Motorola got issues

It's not all dreamy blue everyday.

And this was my first issue.

## Riding in the car

While I was listening to music in the car yesterday morning.

At some point, the music stuttered.

The sound stopped, started again.

It was a nightmare to listen.

Poor car stereo.


Initially thought we were out of 4G coverage.

But no, youtube had already streamed everything.

It seemed more like a bluetooth issue.


## Searching for a solution

While looking for a solution.

I realized that this issue is known to consumers and motorola as well.

A guy mentioned that the G8 US version had no issue.

Mine is the EU version, which is affected by this bug.

If it was a hardware bug, we're done.


## Do or do not, there is no try

I started with the usual troubleshooting.

My reasoning was that since this was my first pairing.

We could clear the temporary bluetooth cache and get it working.


## Clearing bluetooth cache on Android

1. On your mobile, go to Settings

2. Select Apps & Notifications
