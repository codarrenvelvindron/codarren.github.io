![leader featured](https://github.com/codarrenvelvindron/codarrenvelvindron.github.io/raw/master/images/charismatic-leader-positive-leadership.jpg)

A leader is someone who leads (laughs...)

## The Beginning
As far as I can remember, I've always been a loner.

From pre-primary to primary to secondary school, it has been pretty much the same thing.

I used to play alone, and find myself surrounded by people.

Somehow, what I did was of interest to them.

## Never follow
Peer pressure. yes and no.

I followed people because I wanted to.

But I never ever saw myself as a leader.

## Anonymity
As someone who used to be anonymous.

I'm quite surprised at the number of people who would stop and talk to me.


From completely anonymous to knowing a lot of people.

Personally, I preferred being anonymous.

But, knowing a lot of people is good too, you get to discover different personalities.

## Qualities ?
**Listening** : The number one quality of a good leader is the ability to listen to what others have to say.

**Helping** : There is no difference between me and my team. 

As a technical leader, I always find the time to help my people.

**Humbleness** : Always come with a beginner's mind. Then, and only then, you might learn a thing or two.
