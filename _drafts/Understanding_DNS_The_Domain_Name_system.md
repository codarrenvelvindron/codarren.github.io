## DNS, a love story
Domain Name System; A domain name is just another website name(as we know it).

Example: blog.codarren.com is a domain name.

## The horror stories
Before we begin with what DNS actually is, let's talk about the horror stories.

Google.com - In 2016, the google.com domain was sold to Sanmay Ved for $12. 

Google paid $6006.13 to him, to get the domain back before doubling the sum.

## Simply
The best analogy that works for most of us would be the telephone directory.

A telephone directory allows you to look for someone's phone number by searching for his name.

Codarren Velvindron --> 53182111
blog.codarren.com --> 172.67.183.71

## Life without DNS ?
Our lives would be totally different without the DNS.

We'd have a much better memory.
Yes, you read this right.
