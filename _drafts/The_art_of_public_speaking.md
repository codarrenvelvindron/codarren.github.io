Well you should.

## The Beginning
My brother [Loganaden](https://medium.com/@loganaden) was the first person who initated me to public speaking.

I was completely unprepared for that first speech.

And to myself, I believed I was unable to do what public speaking is all about.

## Transfer of knowledge
This is the basis of any great speech.

I felt that I had failed my audience.

As weird as it may sound, a few people came and congratulated me.

I received a lot of positive feedback.

For some months, it haunted me.

## Doing better
That was the only thing on my mind.

On my next chance at this, I had a bad throat, so I had to cancel my speech.

Again, with all the preparation I did for this one, it felt like I was letting down my crowd.

## One year later
This time, I knew what i had to do.

I prepared, 3 months in advance.

Even if my throat was bad in that year, it wouldn't matter.

In that year, I delivered the best speech.

## The secret
I added a personal touch to that one.

I did a readaptation of the ever famous movie line in the movie [Taken](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0936501/), where i said:

"I don't know who you are, I don't know what you want. 

If you are looking for a ransom I can tell you I don't have any money. 

But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills that I have acquired over a very long career, skills that make me a nightmare for **bugs** like you. 

If you let that **code** go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you and I will not pursue you. 

But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, then I will **fix** you."


Then I concluded with the things that people say to discourage you.

And your comeback would be: "Talk is cheap, show me the code" ~ Linus Torvalds.
