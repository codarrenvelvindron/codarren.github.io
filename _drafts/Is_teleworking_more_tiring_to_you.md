## Really?

Then, like me, you have probably been doing it wrong.

## Problem
If you feel like you are working more while teleworking.

You probably are.

If you are working more, you may be what people call a [workaholic](https://www.european-business.com/listicles/0010-ten-signs-that-you-are-a-workaholic).

## Workaholic
A person with excessive devotion to work.

If you enjoy your work to a point where you put some extra hours at work without any additional remuneration.

## Tips to get out of the workaholic zone

### 1. Start and finish on time
- You are working from 9 to 5.

- Turn your computer on at 9 and turn it off at 5.

- If someone comes asking you something at the last minute.

- Assess the impact of not doing it now, if it's not an emergency.

- Then there's still room to do it tomorrow.

- Politely decline and set it for tomorrow.


### 2. Take your breaks
As humans, we were not designed to sit a whole day in front of the computer screen.

We were designed to hunt, and forrage for our food.

But with technological advances, we are sitting more than doing anything else.

- Set a specific time for your lunch break and take them.

- Add them to your outlook calendar as a reminder and take the breaks.

- This helps you feel very organized as well.

### 3. Time your work

Everything you need to work on should be in a calendar invite.

If you finish some work early, prepare for the next piece of work but don't start it until it's time.

### 4. Forget the smartphone

When we disconnect from the computer screen to take  a break.

We should not be watching another screen (smartphone)

Get off that screen and go have a chat with your family.

Enjoy time time really, it won't come back.
