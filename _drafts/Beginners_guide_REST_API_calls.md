## API

**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface

## Defined simply
There are different APIs that are available.

But what we're interested in today are Web APIs.

These involve defined request messages that they will accept, and they will respond with a structured message, usually in the form of XML or JSON.

The aim of doing this is to facilitate data exchange between different web sites.

## Enough Definition
OK let's start with our case scenario.

Someone asked me today about web APIs and the inability to use it.

## Requests are there but...
To my knowledge, API requests are supposed to be simple.

But why are people struggling?

## The API is explicit

## Trying it on a terminal

## Copy-paste not working
What can we do now ?

## Investigate
