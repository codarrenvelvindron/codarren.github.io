## DHCP - Dynamic Host Control Protocol

By the name itself:

**D**ynamic - Changing

**H**ost - Device

**C**ontrol - Rule over

**P**rotocol - A set of rules

It's a set of rules to control changing devices ?


## My one line explanation

DHCP is a protocol that assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

## What's a device ?
A device could be anything, your smartphone, a printer or even a network card.

## What's an IP address ?
Wikipedia.org definition ~ An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. 


That definition is so simple and so accurate that we don't need to add anything.

If your device wants to communicate on the network, it needs an IP address.

That includes, your **smartphone**, **printer** and **network card** ?

## What do these 3 have in common ?
