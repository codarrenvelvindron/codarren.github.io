## DHCP - Dynamic Host Control Protocol

By the name itself:

**D**ynamic - Changing

**H**ost - Device

**C**ontrol - Rule over

**P**rotocol - A set of rules

It's a set of rules to control changing devices ?


## My one line explanation

DHCP is a protocol that assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

## What's a device ?
A device could be anything, your smartphone, a printer or even a network card.
