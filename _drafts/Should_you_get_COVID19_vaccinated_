## We're all thinking about it

And some want to do it and some don't want to do it.

## Is it 100% safe?
No, and no vaccines are really.

It is important to understand that vaccines are created by humans and none of us is perfect.

## Adverse effects
There are adverse effects but they are rare.

**Anaphylaxis**
It's a severe allergic reaction.

And vaccination providers can effectively and immediately treat the reaction.

And this occurs 30 minutes after the vaccination.

And if you got this, you should not get a second shot of it (if using Pfizer/Moderna)

**Severe non-allergic reaction**
This could happen 4 hours after the vaccine.

This non-allergic reaction includes hives, swelling and wheezing(respiratory distress).

You will have to be referred to a specialist in allergies and immunology to provide care or advice.

This part will not be immediately treated.

**Rash/Covid ARM**
This happens a few days or few weeks after and these rashes can be quite large.

Red, itchy,swollen or painful rashes have been experienced by some people.

In this case, you should take an antihistamine.
