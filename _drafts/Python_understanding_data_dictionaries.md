## Data Dictionary

We touch the concept of associative arrays today.

This is another name for data dictionary.

## Definition
A data dictionary is pretty much like a table in which the first column is the key (we can think of it as the primary key in DBs)

## Why ?
We use data dictionaries to store data where each piece of data share some kind of relation to each other.

## How ?
we have to have a dictionary name.

Let's say in this case we have a students dictionary.

```
students = {
'cvelvindron': 'Codarren Velvindron',
'jsnow': 'Jon Snow',
'rvazilito': 'Razor Vazilito',
'harvshrew': 'Harv Shrew',
}
```
