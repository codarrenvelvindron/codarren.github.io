## Stupidity

Today we'll talk about stupidity.

To understand stupidity, we need to understand what intelligence is.

## Intelligence
Wikipedia : "ntelligence has been defined in many ways: the capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving"

## Stupidity is always relative.

Relative to our perception of our own level of intelligence.

To you, your colleague may be stupid, but to a Nikola Tesla 
or an Albert Einstein, where are you situated ?

## I never consider anyone stupid now.
But I used to.

I used to hate talking to those stupidos.
