## 404 not found

We see them all the time, on our browsers.

Did you know that this 404 error is part of an actual standard?

My mission today is to shed some light on http status codes!

## Success - 200
When you go to a website and it loads correctly.

Chances are you got a response code of:
**200 --> OK**

Why you don't see them is another story?

When everything is working perfectly fine, you just don't need to worry.

This is why when you go to any website and it loads properly, you won't see the 200.

But in the background, you are getting this response code of 200.

Your browser is simply not showing it to you.

## Redirect - 30x
All 30x messages are redirection messages.

Redirection simply means that the resource that you requested is not found on this particular page.

And it has been configured that when you request for that very resource, you will get redirected to another url.

**301 --> Moved Permanently**
This means that the URL of the resource has been changed permanently.

**302 --> Found**
URL of the resource changed temporarily as opposed to a 301.
