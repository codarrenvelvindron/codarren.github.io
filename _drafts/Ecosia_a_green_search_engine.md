## What's a green search engine ?
![Ecosia logo](https://github.com/codarrenvelvindron/codarrenvelvindron.github.io/raw/master/images/250px-Ecosia_logo.png)

A search engine that plants trees.

## What is a search engine ?

You are probably already using one.

It's a web app that allows you to search for information on the World-Wide web based on a 'web search query'.

## Why should you use it ?

Ecosia donates 80% or more of its profits to nonprofit organizations that focus on reforestation and planting trees where they are needed most. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosia)


## Is it worth using ?

In my whole IT career I have used a number of search engines.
Bing, yahoo! and Google.

I finally stuck with google.com.


I gave Ecosia.org a try because of it's green appeal.

And I must say, it's a joy to use on a daily basis.

Interface is as neat as google.

## Make it your default search engine.

If you tried and like it as much as I do.

1. [add ecosia to chrome]
(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ecosia-the-search-engine/eedlgdlajadkbbjoobobefphmfkcchfk)

2. Make sure it's your default search engine.

Go to settings > Serch engines > ecosia.org

3. Open a new tab to see if it's here

We're done ! Now every search you do is making a difference !


## Features ? No problem

1. Anonymizes your search queries.

Did you say privacy ?

2. Plants trees for every search you make.

117 million trees already planted worldwide.

Save the planet !
