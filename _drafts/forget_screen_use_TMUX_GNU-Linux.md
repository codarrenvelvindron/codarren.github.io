## Screen

GNU/Linux screen is used to keep your SSH sessions active.

But it's not the only tool out there.

We also have tmux.

## Here's why you should start using TMUX

### 1. Tmux has a wicked interface

Unlike screen which leaves a lot of guessing.

Most of you already most probably know the 'backspace' trick to know if you are in a normal session or a screen session

**tmux** shows a status screen at the bottom.

With date and time, so you don't have to type 'date' everytime to know the time.

Also, this signals that you are in a screen session as it's coloured at the bottom.
