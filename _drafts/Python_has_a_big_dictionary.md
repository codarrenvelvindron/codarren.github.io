![python dictionary](https://github.com/codarrenvelvindron/codarrenvelvindron.github.io/raw/master/images/python-logo.png)

We'll take another practical look at it today.

## Definition
A dictionary is a data store that stores data in key-value pairs.

A dictionary is ordered(as of python 3.7, earlier versions are unordered)

## Creating a dictionary
```
print ('0. Dictionaries are created using curly braces and are of class dict')
my_dict = {}
print (type(my_dict))
```

***Result***
```
0. Dictionaries are created using curly braces and are of type dict
<class 'dict'>
```
A dictionary is created by using curly braces,

Here we are creating an empty dictionary.

## Adding data
```
print ('1. Dictionaries are created by using key-value pairs, separated by commas')
my_dict = {'name' : 'Barry', 'hero' : 'flash', 'speciality' : 'speed'}
print (my_dict)
```

***Result***
```
1. Dictionaries are created by using key-value pairs, separated by commas
{'name': 'Barry', 'hero': 'flash', 'speciality': 'speed'}
```
