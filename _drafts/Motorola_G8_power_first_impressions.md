## Just got it

Yes, I just got my Motorola G8 power.

## An hour review

As usual every time I get a new mobile, I make sure that the full charge is 100%.

I know there are people who might not agree with this.

Some will say we have this and that technology and this is no longer necessary.

## 100% Charge

Thing is, it does make sense to me that when you just got a phone.

You MUST charge it to 100%.


If your battery has never known 100% charge, aren't you depriving it from something ?

Be a good human being.

## Hello moto !
The first time my Motorola booted.

These are her first words.

And dang, it not only says that "Hello Moto" thingy.


It also shows a gorgeous photo animation.

I mean it's a nice touch, no phone spoke to me before at boottime.

Btw did you know that Motorola Mobility is owned by Lenovo ? [Read here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Mobility)

## First impressions
These are mostly positive.

Wait, we'll list some points to see if it is.

## The Good
1. "The hello moto" feeling, this is new to me.

2. The Camera, it's great!
 - Great for me is no filters, shows you the way you really are.
 - Might not be a selling point for everyone
