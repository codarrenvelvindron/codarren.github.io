## Just got it
![Moto](https://github.com/codarrenvelvindron/codarrenvelvindron.github.io/raw/master/images/motorola-moto-g-power-r1.jpg)

Yes, I just got my Motorola G8 power.

## An hour review

As usual every time I get a new mobile, I make sure that the full charge is 100%.

I know there are people who might not agree with this.

Some will say we have this and that technology and this is no longer necessary.

## 100% Charge

Thing is, it does make sense to me that when you just got a phone.

You MUST charge it to 100%.


If your battery has never known 100% charge, aren't you depriving it from something ?

Be a good human being.

## Hello moto !
The first time my Motorola booted.

These are her first words.

And dang, it not only says that "Hello Moto" thingy.


It also shows a gorgeous photo animation.

I mean it's a nice touch, no phone spoke to me before at boottime.

Btw did you know that Motorola Mobility is owned by Lenovo ? [Read here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Mobility)

## First impressions
These are mostly positive.

Wait, we'll list some points to see if it is.

## The Good
1. "The hello moto" feeling, this is new to me.

2. The Camera, it's great!
 - Great for me is no filters, shows you the way you really are.
 - Might not be a selling point for everyone

3. The sound, it's LOUD and CLEAR
 - That sound blew me away, unexpectedly

4. Video playback - Youtube, runs great, no slowness, no lag.

5. The fingerprint scanner, absolutely no complaints.
 - Bad part of my Samsung S7 there.
 - Pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to unlock.
 - No mistakes.

6. Feel in the hand - It's grippy, I would not require any case.
 - If only I was a no fall mobile kindof person that doesn't exist.
 - But I did buy a [Ghostek Covert](https://ghostek.com/products/covert-moto-g-g8-power)
 - Btw that case is great, it also has a back holder that keeps the screen in landscape view brilliantly!

7. The price
 - Did I say that mobile cost me less than $200 ?

8. The battery
 - Uptime 5 hours, 2 hour videos, 93% battery.
 - Updated all apps
 - Synced all my older accounts and pics.
 - 5000 mAH, need I say more?

## The Bad
1. The camera app is just bad.
 - Sluggish, slow to take pictures
 - Laggy all the way, I bet there is a way to make it faster.
 - Will find out !
 - Maybe a lighter camera app skin ?
 
2. The audio
 - It lacks bass.
 - But on a positive note, the voice is very clear.
 - If you like hearing lyrics and singing songs, this one for you.


## Overall
I'm satisfied right now, but i'll give myself more time.

To make a real opinion of this phone.

Thanks for reading!
