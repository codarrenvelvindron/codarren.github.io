## There's always a bigger fish

You can catch it.

But you need a bigger hook and a bigger net.


## Terminals
The dark screen that is so useful to us.

When you buy a GNU/Linux server from a webhost, it does not come with the same features as your desktop.

This should be the case, as most of the time we won't use all those features from a typical desktop environment.

## Let's go right to it !
### Aliases
Aliases are one of the most useful features of terminals.

They allow you to create your own commands based on your needs.

For example, one of the long commands that I type often is:
```
ls -lrth
```

This command allows me to see all files in a directory

- With the newer files at the bottom

- And the oldest files towards the top
