## Temptation

Money in any form it comes is always tempting.

To the materialist at least or maybe the ones with projects of 'grandeur'

## Money Fascination

Money can buy you everything.

Yes, it can buy you everything tangible.

Tangible is that which you can touch.

A car, beautiful stuff, food, clothing pretty much anything.

## What money can't buy ?
**Happiness**

Here we become conversant with the intangibles.

You cannot hold happiness in your hands.

**Love and affection**
If the reason you are loved is not you.

Then, what is the worth of that love ?

**Family**
Can you buy a people around you ?

I'm serious.

For sure friends may feel like family.

But if the only friends you have are gone the minute you don't have money.

**Worth**
Does having a lot of money make you more worthy ?

"I am so great, I have money", said no one ever...

**Success**
This goes both ways.

If the money you earned was 'clean' money.

You will be successful.

If it was not, you better be ready for the consequences.

## Money or a day off
I'll choose a day off everytime.

Why ? Because you can't buy time back.

You can't buy the last 2 years back and go back there.

If time is well spent, you can do many things in that time.

Things that a day's work will never give you.

## "Lost time is never found again." â€“ Benjamin Franklin.
