## Yes, it's different this time
Security is one of the most popular topics in IT.

And one of my most wanted skills on a personal and professional level.

## "Don't Blink or you'll miss me!"
For me, the number one quality that any good sec guy needs to have is:
 **Attention to detail**

## Why?
It's what the bad guys will see first.

They are looking for it right ? The devil is in the details.

If you as someone in the blue team (Defense) wants to counter the red team (Offense).

You need to, first of all, to think like the bad guys.

By being ahead all the time, you will effectively be able to mitigate most flaws before their exploitation.

## Break your own defenses
Now, that's a tricky one.

When you have defenses put in place, you will have the tendency to attack what you already have.

That is not the proper way, you need to try real hard to find the loopholes.

See, the attacker does not know what you have in place.

But by poking a little bit, he will be able to make a map of your defenses. 

Once he figures that one out, we need to have something else prepared for him.


## Being Certified
