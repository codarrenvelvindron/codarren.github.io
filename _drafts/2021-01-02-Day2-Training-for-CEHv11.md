## Yes, it's different this time
Security is one of the most popular topics in IT.

And one of my most wanted skills on a personal and professional level.

## "Don't Blink or you'll miss me!"
For me, the number one quality that any good sec guy needs to have is:
 **Attention to detail**

## Why?
It's what the bad guys will see first.

They are looking for it right ? The devil is in the details.

If you as someone in the blue team (Defense) wants to counter the red team (Offense).

You need, first of all, to think like the bad guys.

By being ahead all the time, you will effectively be able to mitigate most flaws before their exploitation.


## Break your own defenses
Now, that's a tricky one.

When you have defenses put in place, you will have the tendency to attack what you already have.

That is not the proper way, you need to try real hard to find the loopholes.

Simple things like stray headers, can reveal your webserver's version.

If that version is not up-to-date, that's already a possible entry point.

## Being Certified
The syllabus of [CEHv11](https://www.eccouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CEHv11-Brochure.pdf) is hands on:

## How is the course going ?
It's going quite fast but lectures can become quite boring.

Most of the learning that could happen would depend on how passionate your tutor is about his topic.

If that motivation doesn't come from there, it has to come from somewhere else.

## Doing it my way.
My plan is simple.

 - To document every step of the course with a blog post.

This is sure to help me stay motivated and hungry for more.

 - Not listening blindly to the tutors but questioning them (after proper research ofc!)

 - Not expecting too much from the tutors.
Most of the effort has to come from you.
