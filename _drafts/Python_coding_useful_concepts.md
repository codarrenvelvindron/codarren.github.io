## Python

Today, I'm onto Python.

## Rusty
I just got back to python programming.

And I thought I was rusty.

But, the beauty of Python lies in its simple syntax.

Didn't feel rusty at all !

## Looping a count
Here, our goal is to create a count in a particular range.

```
for x in range (1,10):
    print (x)
print ("Finished looping count")
```

**Result**

**Thoughts**
If you wanted to loop to the upper limit of 10 including 10 itself, you need to specify the upper limit as 11.

This is useful in cases where we need to automate number generation.

## Looping a string
Here, we take a string of characters and we loop through it.
```
for x in "ELEPHANT":
    print (x)
print ("Finished looping string")
```

**Result**
