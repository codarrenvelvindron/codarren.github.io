## It can be hard

To dig for gold with a fork.

## The right tools
I have to admit.

I read json the hard way.

When i say the hard way, I meant the super hard way.

By reading a file line by line and looping through.

## Hard finding the right tools
Kind of funny but there wasn't a straightforward guide to showing me the way to do it.

Partly because of the problem I was facing.
## Normal json file
```json
{
"pizzas" : [
	{
      "name": "Kebab King",
      "size": ["small", "medium", "large"],
      "price": ["200", "350", "550"]
    },
	{
      "name": "Vegetarian Paradise",
      "size": ["small", "medium", "large"],
      "price": ["150", "250", "490"]
    }
  ]
}
  
        
```
